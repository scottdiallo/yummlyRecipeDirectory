# Description:
This app allow anyone who love the art of food or simply to cook to look up recipes and challenges themselves to make it. The easy to use interface make it easier to find informations, see pictures and follow links to some really cool videos.

# Why I built this app
I built this app because i love everythong about food  and cooking. My Mother thaught me how to cook since when I was little, so it was easy to convince myself that this is going to be a fun project.
Another reason why I built this app is because I strongly believe there are people like me out there that love food and enjoying cooking.

# Who should use it
This app is built primarly for everyone that sees food as a form of art or love to eat different type of food.
All you gotta do is to look it up and cook it.
# Development Roadmap
1. I am planning on implementing this very cool weather api that will recommend what to cook or eat based on the weather, by automatically detecting user location or inputting it manually.
2. Build a mobile navigation


# Technical
The app is built entirely using jQuery, HTML , CSS.
I made use of AJAX call to the BestBuy api platform to access the information i needed.
